## About Me

Hi, I'm Erica. I am a creative person that loves to solve problems and learn new things, this is why the world of data analysis is perfect for me. I have recently received a certificate in data anlaytics from Toronto Metropolitan University and before that I completed my bachelor of science in physics with a minor in geology from Queen's University. I am always taking new courses online to learn new things and expand my knowledge to become the best analyst that I can be.
