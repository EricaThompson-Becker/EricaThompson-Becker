## About Me

Hi, I'm Erica. I graduated from Queen's University with an Honours Bachelor of Science,
in physics with a minor in geology in 2021. I have recently completed the Data Analytics, Big Data, and 
Predictive Analytics certificate at Toronto Metropolitan University, and graduated in fall 2022. I have 
spent the last year learning how to correctly and efficiently preform statistical and exploratory analysis to solve all 
types of problems. I am very eager to join the exciting world of data analytics.
